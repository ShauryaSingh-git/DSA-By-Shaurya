## Problem Statement

You are given two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.  
The task is to **merge the two lists into a single sorted linked list** and return its head.

---

## Approach

### 1. Handle Edge Cases
- If one of the lists is empty, return the other one directly.

### 2. Initialization
- Compare the first nodes of both lists.
- Select the smaller value as the head of the new merged list.
- Move the pointer of the list whose value was chosen.

### 3. Merge Process
- Traverse both lists simultaneously.
- Compare the current nodes of both lists:
  - Attach the smaller node to the tail of the new list.
  - Move the pointer of that list ahead.
- Move the tail pointer to the newly added node.

### 4. Remaining Nodes
- If one list becomes empty while the other still has nodes,  
  **attach all remaining nodes** of that list to the tail.

### 5. Return Result
- Return the head of the newly merged sorted linked list.

## Visual Representation (Dry Run)

**Input Lists:**
list1: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 4

list2: 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 4


**Merging Process:**
1. Compare `1 (list1)` and `1 (list2)` â†’ Choose `1`  
   Result: `1`

2. Compare `2 (list1)` and `1 (list2)` â†’ Choose `1`  
   Result: `1 â†’ 1`

3. Compare `2 (list1)` and `3 (list2)` â†’ Choose `2`  
   Result: `1 â†’ 1 â†’ 2`

4. Compare `4 (list1)` and `3 (list2)` â†’ Choose `3`  
   Result: `1 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3`

5. Compare `4 (list1)` and `4 (list2)` â†’ Choose `4 (from list1)`  
   Result: `1 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4`

6. `list1` empty, append remaining `list2 (4)`  
   Result: `1 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 4`

## Input (from main function)

list1: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 4

list2: 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 4

## Output

1 1 2 3 4 4
