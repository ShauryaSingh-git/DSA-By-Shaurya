# Problem number-1929 Leetcode
This problem is very basic , that is why it is our first array problem
let the array/vector be [1,2,1] and its size n = 3 which is generally the number of elements inside the array

This problems just wants us to produce its concatination which is it wants the same elememts copied or concatinated behind the original elements few examples-
arr=[1,2,1] size n=3     concatination = arr=[1,2,1,1,2,1] and size N=2n=6
arr=[3,6,7,4,11] size n=5     concatination = arr=[3,6,7,4,11,3,6,7,4,11] and size N=2n=6

## PREREQUISITES-
1. Concepts of vector
2. Loops

---

## TIME COMPLEXITY- 0(n)
1. first for loop - 0(n)
2. second for loop - 0(n)
total= n+n= 2n {we dont count constants} , so time complexity =O(n)
