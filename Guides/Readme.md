# A quick guide for Starting DSA series


Hello! This is Shaurya , I'll be guiding you how can you start your journey in mastering DSA.
First,
What is Data Structures and algoritms?
Simply put, Data structures are way to organise a set of data, and algoritms are some mathematical procedure to solve a problem and perform a task.
These problems are nescessary because-

1. **Efficient-** This is a efficient way of solving a problem , which nowadays big companies demands for.
2. **Builds Logical Thinking-**- These problems helps coders to build logical reasoning to solve a problem, which is cruital for solving the problem structurally.
3. **Important for Coding interviews-**- Tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Infosys, TCS, etc., test your DSA skills to check how well you can think logically and solve problems.

## HOW TO START DSA

**PLATFORMS THAT I PERSONALLY USE** 
1. Neetcode- This is a very good site to get a decent roadmap for whatever you are preparing for , let it be companies , coding compeditions etc.It also has a interactive roadmap which can help you track your progress.
2. Leetcode- This platform is the main platform that we will be using , Our most problems will be available on the leetcode. This site has vast amount of problems with daily challenges.
3. Codechief- It is similar to Leetcode , It also has vast amount of problems , and it also has daily problems and coding contests too.
