## ✅ Prerequisites Before You Start

1. **Basic knowledge of a programming language**  
   (I’ll be using **C++**) — languages like **Java** or **Python** also work.

2. **Must-know Concepts:**
   - Arrays
   - Strings
   - Functions
   - Recursion
   - Classes & Structures
   - STL (Standard Template Library)

3. **Understanding of Pseudocode**  
   Helps to plan logic before writing actual code.

4. **Patience**  
   Some problems may take hours to crack. Don’t give up!

5. **Discipline & Consistency**  
   Regular practice is key to mastering DSA.
